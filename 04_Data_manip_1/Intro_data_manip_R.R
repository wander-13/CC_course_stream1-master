# Set your working directory to where the folder is saved on your computer
setwd()
# it is already set in the R project folder/repo

# Load the elongation data
elongation <- read.csv("EmpetrumElongation.csv", header = TRUE)   

# Check import and preview data
head(elongation)   # first few observations
str(elongation)    # types of variables

# Let's get some information out of this object!
elongation$Indiv   # prints out all the ID codes in the dataset
length(unique(elongation$Indiv))   # returns the number of distinct shrubs in the data

# Here's how we get the value in the second row and fifth column
elongation[2,5]

# Here's how we get all the info for row number 6
elongation[6, ]

# And of course you can mix it all together!
elongation[6, ]$Indiv   # returns the value in the column Indiv for the sixth observation
# (much easier calling columns by their names than figuring out where they are!)
